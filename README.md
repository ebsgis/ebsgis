## Welcome 

I am a Portland-based GIS professional, and I am passionate about  interpreting complex phenomena through geo-visual modeling and cartographic design that helps inform people about the world we inhabit. My interests include mapping and analyzing natural hazards, natural disaster resilience, humanitarian crises, environmental monitoring and sustainability, and community resource mapping. I am excited share my skills and knowledge to help you tell spatial stories.
